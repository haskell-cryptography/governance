# Governance

`haskell-cryptography` (herein referred to as the "Organisation") is a GitHub organisation that aims to provide a support structure to open-source maintainers producing cryptography libraries.

This document elaborates on administrative and operational aspects of the Organisation.

## Administrative aspect

The Organisation's administrative aspects are handled by the Core Team. While a healthy overlap is appreciated between the Core Team and the contributors,
An employee of the Haskell Foundation has a position in the Core Team as to facilitate ecosystem-related matters and discussion with other institutional parties.

## Operational aspect

As an Organisation, `haskell-cryptography` concerns itself with two things:

1. Code production
2. Services related to the code and users

### Code production

`haskell-cryptography` produces a series of projects related to cryptography.
These projects have a referent person that is in charge of being the main point of contact, handle inquiries from the core team and act as an editor for the project.

This role involves making concrete the strategy of the core team, and being in charge of the management of the project,
whithin the framework established by the guidelines published in the `haskell-cryptography/governance` repository.
The referent person is  autonomous but held accountable. This doesn't prevent a decision proces that is involving multiple parties in a "flat"
governance structure for a project, but the referent is the one person that is in charge of making these decisions official, answering for them and enforcing them.

### Services related to the code and users

As a support structure for open-source maintainers, `haskell-cryptography` has the ability to host projects of the Haskell ecosystem related to cryptography,
should their maintainer decide that this is the best course of action for their project. By transferring a project to the organisation, the authors of a project
do not implictly relinquish their permissions, authorship and ownership of the project, and benefit from the collaborators of the organisation to help them
with tasks they need help with. 

Projects can be donated for historical preservation or to seek new leadership.
